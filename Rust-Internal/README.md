# Rust-Internal-Base
Hello so this is a ESP rust internal i coded it used discord Overlay sigs to draw its menu as well as it has IMGui and you can basically code your own sdk from this as this was just a nice rust internal base i wanted to release as i dont have any use for my code anymore be aware this will need an update but apart from that it injects past eac just remove minhook as EAC flags it but apart from that i lasted 2 weeks with this purely just esp then i added aimbot and other features and fully rewrote it but just found my original base lying around my pc before i delete it why not upload it
